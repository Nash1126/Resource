## L293D MOTOR DRIVER
This L293D motor driver IC works on the basic H-bridge principle to control the DC motor’s rotation direction. In this principle, the H-Bridge controls the rotating direction of the DC motor by simply changing its input voltage polarity. An H-bridge circuit generally has four transistors like BJTs or MOSFETs and the motor in the middle forms an H-bridge configuration. The current flow direction can be changed by simply triggering two particular switches simultaneously, so in this way, the motor’s rotation direction in any direction can be changed.

# PULSE WIDTH MODULATION
Pulse-width modulation (PWM), also known as pulse-duration modulation (PDM) or pulse-length modulation (PLM), is any method of representing a signal as a rectangular wave with a varying duty cycle (and for some methods also a varying period).

# H-BRIDGE
An H-bridge is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of a voltage applied to a load. These circuits are often used in robotics and other applications to allow DC motors to run forwards or backwards. The name is derived from its common schematic diagram representation, with four switching elements configured as the branches of a letter "H" and the load connected as the cross-bar.
